TensorFlow2 implementation of Conditional Frechet Inception Distance metric. For example, given a low-resolution (LR) image, ground-truth high-resolution image (HR) and some super-resolution model (SR). The CFID metric is able to measure the exact distance between HR and SR given LR. In comparison to classic Frechet Inception Distance (FID), CFID considers the input LR image. It measure×“ the similarity between HR and SR regarding the input image. Unlike FID, CFID requires paired (LR,HR) data for comparison.

We also describe RFID metric as condidate for measuring the distance between distributions, as more simple variant. The corresponding graphical models describe the difference between the metrics:

**Note**: The current software works well with TensorFllow 2.4.0

### Formulas

The CFID formula is rather similiar to FID thus simple and easy to implement. Given:

CFID defined as follows:

## Example results
'good' models defined to be those which output corellate visually with the input. For example when the SR image could be donwsampled back to it's LR input. CFID distinguish between 'good' and 'bad' models while the classic FID metric doesn't. Most of the models that trained on paired data considered to be 'good'. 
We provide comparasion of CFID with FID on 'good' and 'bad' models. 

The 'good' models are: [Pix2Pix](https://phillipi.github.io/pix2pix/) and [BiCycle-GAN](https://junyanz.github.io/BicycleGAN/) (The were trained on paired data).

The 'bad' models are: [Cycle-GAN](https://junyanz.github.io/CycleGAN/) and [MUNIT](https://github.com/NVlabs/MUNIT) (They were trained on un-paired data) 

The models were trained on [Celeb-A](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/celeb_a) dataset
